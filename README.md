Installation
============

In the main project directory, use:

        sudo make && make install

If you don't have sudo access, but do have root access, the following will work:

        su -c "make && make install"
        
To build locally, without installing

        make

You may want to run
        
        make clean

afterwards, to remove object and build files.

Uninstallation
=============

In the main project directory, use:
        
        make uninstall
